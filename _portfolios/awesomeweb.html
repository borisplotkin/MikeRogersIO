  <p class="lead">AwesomeWeb is a simple freelance marketplace to help clients find and hire designers and developers for their projects.</p>

  <p>My main role at AwesomeWeb was to build out new ideas while maintaining current features in an agile way. It's mostly written in Ruby on Rails, but in this project I also worked with Bootstrap SASS &amp; jQuery.</p>

  <h2>Search</h2>

  <p>A key piece of functionality I wrote was the search, this required Projects and Freelances to be filtered based on their relevance to the search query. To achieve this I used a mix of Apache Solr and Memcache.</p>

  <h2>Landing Pages</h2>

  <p>I implemented the landing pages based upon designs provided by our designer. I then worked with the designer and project manager to really build a brilliant page that could drive sales.</p>
